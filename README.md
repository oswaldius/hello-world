# hello-world
Curious experiment
Stumbled here on my quest to answer some programming questions
about java and using it to control devices on my raspberrypi 3 b+.
I have attached to it a Matrix Voice unit and am now trying to learn 
how to program them both, with the eventual aim of developing an interactive device 
capable of interacting with a wide variety of environmental variables.
